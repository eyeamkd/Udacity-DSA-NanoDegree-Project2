# Explnation for the BlockChain Problem 

Every block is a class, since it's a repeated entity with specific properties 

Every block has the properties of 
- timestamp
- data
- hash
- next block

BlockChain is a class that contains list of blocks 

At a given timeframe, we can traverse through the blockChain using the head block and calling on the next property of the head block 

I've also created a method to add more blocks using the "add" method
