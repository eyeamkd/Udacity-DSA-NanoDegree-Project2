# Explanation for Union Intersection problem 

Created a Group class, inorder to make the code reusable 

added the functions: 

*add_group* which is used to add a group inside another group 

*add_user* which is used to add a user inside a group

*get_groups* which is used to return all the groups inside a group

*get_users* which is used to return all the users inside a group 

*is_user_in_group* which is used to check if a user exists in a group 

Used to concept of normalization and Flattening objects to have a central dictionary that stores every users's information that way I don't have to go deep searching or also do recursive
